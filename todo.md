#TODO



  - The entire grade results system of caclculation is not working efficiently, we need to implement
    more caching and more optimised speedy queries to make it fully functional.

  - Grade Results: Refactor the grading system. Would be good to have all grade data in cache tables
    so we can query results over time and generate fast reports of data across all subjects in the same profile. 
    Also optimise the current SQL queries as they are rather large and cumbersome, 
    This makes them hard to edit and maintain.
    
  - Skills Results: Check that the skills results is as optimised as possible. Convert the SQL 
    back to PHP if need be, redesign the tables if needed.
